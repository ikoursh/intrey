# Intrey (DEPRECATED)

Hi this project was built as part of an entrepreneurship program.
Because it did not move onto the next stage, we are open-sourcing this project. 


It attempts to tackle political polarization by creating a social media network where users are forced to see posts they dissagree with. This is done using a neural network that attempts to predict political bias in political posts. We also created a feature that allows users to discuss (via text) controversial political posts with partners chosen using AI.
